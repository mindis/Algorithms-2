/*
To tell whether a graph is a valid tree, we have to:

Make sure there is no cycle in the graph - this has to be a none-cyclic graph;
Make sure every node is reached - this has to be a connected graph;
Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)

Solution:

To test cyclic, we can make an array for each node (as array index), and the array will store the parent of the node (as array index). Every time we fetch a new pair of nodes, we trace the root node (the deepest parent node) of these two nodes, if it has the same root, then is will be a cycle; otherwise, we set the parent of second node to be the first node;
After we make sure there is node cycle in the graph, we simple test if there is enough edges to make this graph connected.*/

class Solution {
public:
    bool validTree(int n, vector<pair<int, int>>& edges) {
        vector<int> nodes(n,0);
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) nodes[i] = i;
        for(int i=0; i<edges.size(); i++){
            int f = edges[i].first;
            int s = edges[i].second;
            while(nodes[f]!=f) f = nodes[f];
            while(nodes[s]!=s) s = nodes[s];
            if(nodes[f] == nodes[s]) return false;
            nodes[s] = f;
        }
        return edges.size() == n-1;
    }
};
