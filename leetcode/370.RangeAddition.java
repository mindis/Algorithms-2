/*
segment [i,j] is made of two parts [0,i-1] and [0, j]
so [i,j] increase 2 is same as [0,j] increase 2 and [0,i-1] increase -2. so you only need to update value at nums[j] with inc and nums[i-1] -inc. initially nums[i] is defined as all elements [0,i] increases inc

then think from length-1 to 0 backward. The last spot nums[length-1] does not need any modification.
nums[length-2] value should be updated as nums[length-2] + nums[length-1] as the latter covers the front. but front does not influence what is after it. so every spot should be updated as + the accumulate sum from the end.
