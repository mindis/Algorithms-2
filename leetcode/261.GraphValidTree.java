/*
To tell whether a graph is a valid tree, we have to:

Make sure there is no cycle in the graph - this has to be a none-cyclic graph;
Make sure every node is reached - this has to be a connected graph;
Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)

Solution:

To test cyclic, we can make an array for each node (as array index), and the array will store the parent of the node (as array index). Every time we fetch a new pair of nodes, we trace the root node (the deepest parent node) of these two nodes, if it has the same root, then is will be a cycle; otherwise, we set the parent of second node to be the first node;
After we make sure there is node cycle in the graph, we simple test if there is enough edges to make this graph connected.*/
