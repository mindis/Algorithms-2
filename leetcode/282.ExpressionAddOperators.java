/*
Given a string that contains only digits 0-9 and a target value, return all possibilities to add binary operators (not unary) +, -, or * between the digits so they evaluate to the target value.

Examples: 
"123", 6 -> ["1+2+3", "1*2*3"] 
"232", 8 -> ["2*3+2", "2+3*2"]
"105", 5 -> ["1*0+5","10-5"]
"00", 0 -> ["0+0", "0-0", "0*0"]
"3456237490", 9191 -> []
*/
/*
This problem has a lot of edge cases to be considered:

overflow: we use a long type once it is larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE or minimum, we get over it.
0 sequence: because we can't have numbers with multiple digits started with zero, we have to deal with it too.
a little trick is that we should save the value that is to be multiplied in the next recursion.
*/

/*
I am really curios to know how did you arrive at the equation of recursive expression for multiplication in the below line ?
helper(rst, path + "*" + cur, num, target, i + 1, eval - multed + multed * cur, multed * cur );

I couldn't get this expression and as a result my solution became very lengthy :)

for example, if you have a sequence of 12345 and you have proceeded to 1 + 2 + 3, now your eval is 6 right? If you want to add a * between 3 and 4, you would take 3 as the digit to be multiplied, so you want to take it out from the existing eval. You have 1 + 2 + 3 * 4 and the eval now is (1 + 2 + 3) - 3 + (3 * 4). Hope this could help : )

        helper(rst, "", num, target, 0, 0, 0);

                rst.add(path);

        }
        for(int i = pos; i < num.length(); i++){
            if(i != pos && num.charAt(pos) == '0') break;
            long cur = Long.parseLong(num.substring(pos, i + 1));
            if(pos == 0){
                helper(rst, path + cur, num, target, i + 1, cur, cur);
